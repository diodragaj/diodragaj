# Hi there, I'm Dio! 👋

> **Computer Science Student** @ FH Technikum Wien | **Co-Inventor** (Patent Pending)
> Focused on **Systems Programming**, **Memory Safety**, and **Distributed Systems**.

I bridge the gap between electrical engineering fundamentals and modern software architecture. My passion lies in low-level programming (C/C++), understanding manual memory management, and building robust, safe systems for critical environments.
